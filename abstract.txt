An Exploratory Study of the Pull-based Software Development Model

ABSTRACT
The advent of distributed version control systems has led to the development of a new paradigm for distributed software develop-ment; instead of pushing changes to a central repository, developers pull them from other repositories and merge them locally. Various code hosting sites, notably Github, have tapped on the opportunity to facilitate pull-based development by offering workflow support tools, such as code reviewing systems and integrated issue track-ers. In this work, we explore how pull-based software development works, first on the GHTorrent corpus and then on a carefully se-lected sample of 88 projects. We find that the pull request model offers fast turnaround, increased opportunities for community en-gagement and significantly decreased time to incorporate contribu-tions. Moreover, we show that a relatively small number of factors affect both the decision to merge a pull request and the time to pro-cess it.
